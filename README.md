# R-MySQL_OpenXC_data
# 
# This R code is meant to work with vehicle data from Ford's open-source OpenXC project (I have no affiliation with this group). 
# Before using the code, you must either obtain a JSON drive trace file from the OpenXC web site, or generate your own JSON trace files using a Reference VI. 
# 
# The OpenXC project offers code that more efficiently reads in data and offers visualizations - this R code was meant for use within 
# R, as well as connection with a MySQL database.
